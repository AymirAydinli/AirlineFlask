Purpose of our project is to create web-application related to airline ticket reservation system. In the main interface, the client will see table that requires information about original country, destination country, departure time, return time and search button. After finding available routes, app will require some information from passenger. In case of filling in everything correctly, the ticket will be booked, and the customer will see booking information and his/her detailed information in screen. At the end, we will create a login page for consumer who can enter his email and document number. He will be able to check his booking details.
